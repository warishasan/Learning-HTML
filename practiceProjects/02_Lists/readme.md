   - Italy: Pizza, Pasta
   - Japan: Sushi, Ramen
   - Mexico: Tacos, Guacamole
   - India: Curry, Biryani

5. In a new paragraph, provide a quote about cultural diversity using the `<blockquote>` tag. Include a `<cite>` element to attribute the quote to its author.

6. Write a bullet-point list using the `<ul>` tag to enumerate the benefits of exploring global cuisines.

7. Create a subheading "My Culinary Journey" using appropriate heading tags.

Ensure your HTML document is properly structured and utilize suitable text markup and list tags for each requirement. Validate your document in a web browser to confirm that the elements are accurately displayed and formatted.
