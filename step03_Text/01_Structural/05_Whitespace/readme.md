In order to make code easier to
read, web page authors often
add extra spaces or start some
elements on new lines.
When the browser comes across
two or more spaces next to each
other, it only displays one space.
Similarly if it comes across a line
break, it treats that as a single
space too. This is known as
white space collapsing.
You will often see that web page
authors take advantage of white
space collapsing to indent their
code in order to make it easier
to follow
