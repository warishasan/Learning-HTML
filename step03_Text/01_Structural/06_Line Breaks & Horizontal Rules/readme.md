# `<br />`

As you have already seen, the
browser will automatically show
each new paragraph or heading
on a new line. But if you wanted
to add a line break inside the
middle of a paragraph you can
use the line break tag `<br />`.

# `<hr />`

To create a break between
themes — such as a change of
topic in a book or a new scene
in a play — you can add a
horizontal rule between sections
using the <`hr />` tag.
There are a few elements that
do not have any words between
an opening and closing tag. They
are known as empty elements
and they are written differently.
An empty element usually
has only one tag. Before the
closing angled bracket of an
empty element there will often
be a space and a forward slash
character. Some web page
authors miss this out but it is a
good habit to get into.
