# Bold

By enclosing words in the tags
`<b>` and `</b>` we can make
characters appear bold.
The `<b>` element also represents
a section of text that would be
presented in a visually different
way (for example key words in a
paragraph) although the use of
the `<b>` element does not imply
any additional meaning.

# Italic

By enclosing words in the tags
`<i>` and `</i>` we can make
characters appear italic.
The `<i>` element also represents
a section of text that would be
said in a different way from
surrounding content â€” such as
technical terms, names of ships,
foreign words, thoughts, or other
terms that would usually be
italicized.
