# Summary of Previous Steps

- HTML pages are text documents.
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
  brackets) to give the information they surround special
  meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
  the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
  the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
  about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
  available for you to use, what they do, and where they
  can go.


# What will we learn in this step

In this step, we focus on how to add text that appears on your pages. You will learn about:

**Structural Markup for Text:**

The elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.

Few examples are:

- Headings: HTML provides six levels of headings from `<h1>` to `<h6>`. They are used to create hierarchical headings for sections and sub-sections of the content.

- Paragraphs: `<p>` tag is used to create paragraphs of text. It is the most common way to group sentences and text content.

**Semantic Markup for Text:**

It provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on.

Few examples are:

- Emphasis: `<em>` tag is used to provide emphasis to text. Typically, it is displayed in italics.

- Strong Emphasis: `<strong>` tag is used to provide stronger emphasis to text. It is typically displayed in bold.

- Abbreviations: `<abbr>` tag is used to define abbreviations or acronyms. The full form can be displayed when the user hovers over the abbreviation.

- Citations: `<cite>` tag is used to indicate the title of a work or reference that is being cited.

- Quotations:
   - Blockquote: `<blockquote>` tag represents a block-level quotation, often indented and visually distinguished from the surrounding text.
   - Inline Quote: `<q>` tag represents an inline quotation, typically surrounded by quotation marks.

Using appropriate structural and semantic markup for text ensures proper organization and understanding of the content, making it more accessible to users and enhancing its meaning and context.
